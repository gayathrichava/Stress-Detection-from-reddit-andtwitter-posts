Stress detection from social media using nlp techniques. Journal of Social Computing, 8(3):123â€“135, 2022. FOur datasets are provided in the datasets folder.
# CODE
From the data loading to model training and testing was done in the one file. In the codes folder you can see the complete codes for all the four datasets.We used the pre-trained DistilBERT model for stress detection.
